        <p> Spirometers are used to measure lung capacity and response of lungs and chest during
physical therapy. They reveal whether the patient's dyspnoea is due to cardiac or
pulmonary dysfunction and are used to detect asthma. Unfortunately their applica-
tion is limited due to high instrument cost and available low cost devices are with
lack of accuracy.
In addition to that Pulse Oximeter is the device which is used in measuring arte-
rial oxygen (SpO2) concentration and pulse rate. Pulse Oximeter is widely used in
emergency health care to continue monitoring of a patient who is subjected to venti-
lation and etc.
A transmission Pulse Oximeter together with a Spirometer was developed under this
project. In developing Pulse Oximeter red LED and IR LED were used as the light
sources and a photo diode had been used as the detector. In Spirometer Motorola
MPX2010D pressure sensor was used to measure the fl
ow rate.
In order to present the data retrieved by both the above devices a software appli-
cation was developed using visual C#. </p>

        <p> Energy harvesting technology has the ability to create autonomous, self-powered elec-
tronic and electrical systems that do not rely on battery power for their operation.
The term energy harvesting describes the process of converting ambient energy sur-
rounding a system into useful electrical energy through the use of a specic material
or transducer. Piezoelectric materials have long been used as sensors and actuators.
However their use as electrical generators is less established. In this report the area
of energy harvesting by both pressure and vibration are presented. This report de-
tails on the energy harvesting by piezoelectric discs. Piezoelectric discs are used to
harvest energy by using both the pressure and vibration. Results obtained by using
the piezo discs and the relation between the power and the number of steps to charge
re-chargeable batteries are also included. Using thicker materials and materials with
higher voltage constants to harvest maximum energy is written. Then this report
describes how to use piezoelectric materials to harvest maximum energy from vibra-
tions. Finally suggestions and further implementations are given on various methods
of energy harvesting by piezoelectric material. </p>

audio is difficult, or when the action of writing and typing is difficult, but the possibility of vision exists. 
This report describes two approaches in developing a sign language recognition system using a pair of accelegloves. 
In the first method neural network based recognition was used whereas software development tool kit (SDK) integrated 
with the glove was used in the second method. In the second method system has the capability of recognizing both single
 hand static, dynamic gestures and two hand static, dynamic gestures. Also the system can recognize gesture of Sinhala, 
Tamil and American Sign Languages. Recognized gestures of American Sign Language are translated into voice in real time. 
For Sinhala and Tamil Sign Language the recognized gestures are translated into text only.
 The completed package includes the user friendly features such as creating and editing gesture libraries, 
Deleting libraries and real time recognition of the created libraries.</p>

to a great extent that imagining a world without these innovations is hardly possible.
While technology is on the raising slope, we should also note the increasing immoral
activities. Power theft is a silent crime that is highly prevalent and at the same time it
directly affects the economy of a nation. The final result is the increment in the cost
of a power unit. Therefore, the necessity of engineering knowledge is raised to find a
really applicable solution for this problem. Power distribution companies have already
discovered that there are so many ways of power thefts. With these observations the
solution going to be given should be an all-rounder to be more worthwhile. Therefore,
the most appropriate solution is the Wireless Power Theft Monitoring System.</p>

        <p>The importance of irrigation scheduling is that it enables the agronomist to apply the exact amount of water to achieve goals. This increases irrigation efficiency. A critical element is accurate measurement of soil moisture content in the field. Smart Phone Based Irrigation Planning and Controlling System keeps the water level of the soil in its optimum level in order to obtain good harvest.
The proposed system consists of several components to provide not only user friendly environment but also accurate controlling facilities.
The system hardware components are small in size with low weight and less power consumption. In order to give a better solution for agronomist, this system can be controlled in different locations with the use of smart phone. The system provides details of the field such as temperature, humidity apart from soil moisture content. Optimum utilization of water will increase the performances of irrigation system by reducing the water wastage. Also this system will help to assure the required quality of the crops and will suit for current situation of Sri Lanka as well as the world.

        <p>Analog to Digital conversion of electric power is widely employed in many industrial applications. 
A majority of the power electronic applications in industrial applications make use of controlled DC power. 
The trend is to use the inexpensive rectifiers with diodes to convert the input AC into DC in a controlled manner, using rectifiers with diodes. 
But they have the problems of poor power quality in terms of injected current harmonics. 
These rectifiers draw highly distorted current from the utility. Resultant voltage distortions and poor power factor at input AC mains and 
slowly varying rippled DC output at load end. There are several ways to overcome from these problems.
Our goal is to develop them to a matured level with improved power quality.</p>

        <p>The use of fuel cells for power generation is a better solution for the energy crisis which we are facing nowadays and is also a clean source of energy that have a much lower environmental impact than conventional energy technologies. But the unstable nature of the power delivered by the fuel cell needs the association of power electronic interfaces in order to be used in operating electrical/electronic loads. This project “Application of Power Electronics in Fuel Cell Systems” is based on the design and development process of a power electronic interface for fuel cell systems, in order to fulfill the requirement of power conditioning.</p>

        <p>This project is the design and implementation of a three phase voltage source inverter (VSI) which uses Space Vector Pulse Width Modulation (SVPWM) as the switching technique. SVPWM is a new efficient and effective PWM method compared to other common PWM techniques. Three phase voltage source inverter is a very critical component which is used to convert dc voltage into three phase ac voltage in renewable energy sector and industrial applications such as VFDs. The SVPWM technique is introduced and implemented in a microcontroller in order to drive the VSI. The generated SVPWM signals must be properly used at the switching elements to ensure the smooth functioning of the VSI. To achieve this task isolator and inverter gate driver circuits are designed. The developed system was tested in several stages. The obtained results are compared with the performance of sinusoidal 
PWM technique..</p>

        <p>This project was developed an interface for getting optimal energy from the renewable sources. Here mainly considered about solar power and developed MPPT circuit to get optimal power from solar panel considering sun radiation and ambient temperature.
After taking maximum power form solar panel, output current values were adjusted as required for charging battery. Then DC output was inverted through inverter circuit. If renewable power sources are not enough to charge or if the battery is discharged the system will shift to redundant power supply using switching circuit.
For monitoring purposes sun radiation, ambient temperature, output voltages of each step were measured and displayed in LCD.</p>

        <p>The objective of the Sign Language to Voice Converter is to provide eficient commu-
nication mediator for hearing impaired people and normal people. This objective is
achieved using major two categories(
Word mode,Letter mode ) .

In Word mode, when the ASL sign language word is acted it is converted to
English word. For this purpose, sophisticated algorithm and Articial Neural Net-
work(NN) are used.

In Letter mode, letters in the ASL are identied using template matching techniques. 
The image of the hand is captured and the image is enhanced using noise reduction techniques. And after that using template matching,
the letter is identified. 

 User interface of the application is design using Tile and Metro Concepts. And
the whole application can be operated without touching the mouse. In other words,
Mouse operation is embedded to hand. Therefore using hand, mouse cursor can be
moved and click operation can be performed. This makes the user comfortable with
the operation and gives a novel experience to the user.</p>
