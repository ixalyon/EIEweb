Abstract;
The importance of irrigation scheduling is that it enables the agronomist to apply the exact amount of water to achieve goals. This increases irrigation efficiency. A critical element is accurate measurement of soil moisture content in the field. Smart Phone Based Irrigation Planning and Controlling System keeps the water level of the soil in its optimum level in order to obtain good harvest.
The proposed system consists of several components to provide not only user friendly environment but also accurate controlling facilities.
The system hardware components are small in size with low weight and less power consumption. In order to give a better solution for agronomist, this system can be controlled in different locations with the use of smart phone. The system provides details of the field such as temperature, humidity apart from soil moisture content. Optimum utilization of water will increase the performances of irrigation system by reducing the water wastage. Also this system will help to assure the required quality of the crops and will suit for current situation of Sri Lanka as well as the world.
