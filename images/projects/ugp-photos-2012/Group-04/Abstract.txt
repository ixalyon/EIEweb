- In-Shoe Plantar Pressure Analyzer -

Measuring plantar pressure is vital in walk and stance research for diagnosing disabilities for avoiding injuries in human lower limbs. 
It is also used in industrial research to design comfortable footwear, optimize footwear for sports and other applications.
This paper presents designing and implementing of low cost Plantar Pressure Analyzer which is used to gather and 
analyze plantar pressure variation of the foot with and without footwear. 
In this analyzer Force sensing Resistor (FSR) sensors are integrated to a wearable sensor sock and 
a data acquisition system is in built with both Bluetooth and USB interfaces to capture data. 
Professionally developed data analyzing software is included to perform both synchronous and asynchronous analysis 
designed to a give rich graphical experience to the end user
