Abstract
Sign language is the most frequently used tool among deaf of hard of hearing people when the transmission of 
audio is difficult, or when the action of writing and typing is difficult, but the possibility of vision exists. 
This report describes two approaches in developing a sign language recognition system using a pair of accelegloves. 
In the first method neural network based recognition was used whereas software development tool kit (SDK) integrated 
with the glove was used in the second method. In the second method system has the capability of recognizing both single
 hand static, dynamic gestures and two hand static, dynamic gestures. Also the system can recognize gesture of Sinhala, 
Tamil and American Sign Languages. Recognized gestures of American Sign Language are translated into voice in real time. 
For Sinhala and Tamil Sign Language the recognized gestures are translated into text only.
 The completed package includes the user friendly features such as creating and editing gesture libraries, 
Deleting libraries and real time recognition of the created libraries.
