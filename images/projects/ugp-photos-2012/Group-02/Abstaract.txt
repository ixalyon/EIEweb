Energy harvesting technology has the ability to create autonomous, self-powered elec-
tronic and electrical systems that do not rely on battery power for their operation.
The term energy harvesting describes the process of converting ambient energy sur-
rounding a system into useful electrical energy through the use of a specic material
or transducer. Piezoelectric materials have long been used as sensors and actuators.
However their use as electrical generators is less established. In this report the area
of energy harvesting by both pressure and vibration are presented. This report de-
tails on the energy harvesting by piezoelectric discs. Piezoelectric discs are used to
harvest energy by using both the pressure and vibration. Results obtained by using
the piezo discs and the relation between the power and the number of steps to charge
re-chargeable batteries are also included. Using thicker materials and materials with
higher voltage constants to harvest maximum energy is written. Then this report
describes how to use piezoelectric materials to harvest maximum energy from vibra-
tions. Finally suggestions and further implementations are given on various methods
of energy harvesting by piezoelectric material.
