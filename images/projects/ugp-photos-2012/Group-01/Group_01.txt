Developing Spirometer with Pulse Oximeter

Spirometers are used to measure lung capacity and response of lungs and chest during
physical therapy. They reveal whether the patient's dyspnoea is due to cardiac or
pulmonary dysfunction and are used to detect asthma. Unfortunately their applica-
tion is limited due to high instrument cost and available low cost devices are with
lack of accuracy.
In addition to that Pulse Oximeter is the device which is used in measuring arte-
rial oxygen (SpO2) concentration and pulse rate. Pulse Oximeter is widely used in
emergency health care to continue monitoring of a patient who is subjected to venti-
lation and etc.
A transmission Pulse Oximeter together with a Spirometer was developed under this
project. In developing Pulse Oximeter red LED and IR LED were used as the light
sources and a photo diode had been used as the detector. In Spirometer Motorola
MPX2010D pressure sensor was used to measure the flow rate.
In order to present the data retrieved by both the above devices a software appli-
cation was developed using visual C#.
