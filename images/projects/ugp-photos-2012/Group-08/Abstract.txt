Abstract
On the earth the RF energy has been spread in everywhere while being absorbed by all the moving and fixed things and finally results the heat which has some role on global warming. If it could be possible to gather the energy and store it effectively, it could be potentially used to power other circuits. It is a green technology which reduces the increment of global warming by utilizing the RF energy in effective manner. This paper presents an implementation of a micro scale RF energy harvesting unit, based on the associated power of the frequency channels in the RF spectrum. This work includes antenna designing and measurement, circuit development, implementing stage and testing procedures.
