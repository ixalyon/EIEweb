Science and technology with all its miraculous advancements has fascinated human life
to a great extent that imagining a world without these innovations is hardly possible.
While technology is on the raising slope, we should also note the increasing immoral
activities. Power theft is a silent crime that is highly prevalent and at the same time it
directly affects the economy of a nation. The final result is the increment in the cost
of a power unit. Therefore, the necessity of engineering knowledge is raised to find a
really applicable solution for this problem. Power distribution companies have already
discovered that there are so many ways of power thefts. With these observations the
solution going to be given should be an all-rounder to be more worthwhile. Therefore,
the most appropriate solution is the Wireless Power Theft Monitoring System.
