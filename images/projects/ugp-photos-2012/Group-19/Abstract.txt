in this project we have developed an automated medical ventilator at a low cost 
by using a existing manual portable ventilator called ambu bag.
 we have developed a compressing mechanism for that ambu bag and to control the relevant output parameters 
we have developed a micro-control based circuit and developed an android application 
for a mobile phone  to control those values by remotely.
