The objective of the Sign Language to Voice Converter is to provide ecient commu-
nication mediator for hearing impaired people and normal people. This objective is
achieved using major two categories.
 Word mode
 Letter mode

In Word mode, when the ASL sign language word is acted it is converted to
English word. For this purpose, sophisticated algorithm and Articial Neural Net-
work(NN) are used.

In Letter mode, letters in the ASL are identied using template matching techniques. 
The image of the hand is captured and the image is enhanced using noise reduction techniques. And after that using template matching,
the letter is identfied. 

 User interface of the application is design using Tile and Metro Concepts. And
the whole application can be operated without touching the mouse. In other words,
Mouse operation is embedded to hand. Therefore using hand, mouse cursor can be
moved and click operation can be performed. This makes the user comfortable with
the operation and gives a novel experience to the user.
