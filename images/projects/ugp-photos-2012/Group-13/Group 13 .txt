This project is the design and implementation of a three phase voltage source inverter (VSI)
 
which uses Space Vector Pulse Width Modulation (SVPWM) as the switching technique. SVPWM is a new 

efficient and effective PWM method compared to other common PWM techniques. Three phase voltage 

source inverter is a very critical component which is used to convert dc voltage into three 

phase ac voltage in renewable energy sector and industrial applications such as VFDs. The SVPWM

technique is introduced and implemented in a microcontroller in order to drive the VSI. The generated 

SVPWM signals must be properly used at the switching elements to ensure the smooth functioning of the VSI.

To achieve this task isolator and inverter gate driver circuits are designed. The developed system 

was tested in several stages. The obtained results are compared with the performance of sinusoidal 

PWM technique.
